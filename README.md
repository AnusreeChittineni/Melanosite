Developed a deep learning-based computer vision pipeline to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant using dermoscopic images. Leveraged convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the ISIC 2024 dataset to achieve high diagnostic accuracy. Incorporated advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model evaluation techniques to enhance generalizability. Aimed at supporting early detection of melanoma and assisting dermatological diagnostics. Currently developing a front end for easy usage.
